### The Brewery ###

The Monastery of Christ in the Desert has operated a small brewery, Abbey Beverage Company, since 2005. As of 2012 it is the only monastery-run brewery in the United States. The brewery produces three beers: Monks' Ale, Monks' Wit, and Monks' Tripel. The beers are currently brewed at the Monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Pecos and under contract by Sierra Blanca Brewing in Moriarty, but a new brewery located at the monastery itself is set to replace the Pecos facility. Abbey Beverage Co. currently has distribution in eight states, with plans for gradual expansion in the future. [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Christ_in_the_Desert#Brewing)

### The Beer ###

Wit beer, white beer, la bière blanche, or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented ale. The suspended yeast and wheat proteins and starches,which cause the beer to look hazy, or white when cold, gives the beer its name. It is descendant from medieval beers which were brewed not with hops but with “gruit” as a preservative and source of flavor since gruit was a blend of spices and other plants.  Today the gruit consists mainly of coriander, sweet and bitter orange, and other spices.  Most modern wit ales also use hops.  The suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle.

Monks’ Wit is distinctly fruity and spicy.  The yeast lends a note of spice that accentuates the imported coriander, sweet and bitter orange peel, and other spices.  The malt provides a sweet, bready quality up front and a round fruitiness in the middle.  The wheat and oats lend a creamy taste. The imported hops and spices lend a clean, dry, finish to this light, refreshing ale. [(Source)](http://www.christdesert.org/PDF/MonksWit_Data_Sheet.pdf)
