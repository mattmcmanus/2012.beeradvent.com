### The Brewery

Yards Brewing Company was founded in 1994 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by friends Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit who began producing their own homebrews in 1988. Within the first few months, "the Yards Guys" were producing one six-keg batch at a time out of their 3.5-barrel brewhouse, and supplying ESA, Entire Porter, and several other cask-conditioned ales to bars clamoring for their wares. They delivered each keg themselves, making a point of being there whenever a bar tapped its first one. In 1999, Bovit left Yards for financial reasons. The same year he was replaced by new partners Bill and Nancy Barton. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yards_Brewing_Company)

### The Beer

Brewed to rally his thirsty field soldiers, General Washington’s Tavern Porter™ is smooth, rich, and warming with chocolate and coffee flavors. It’s inspired by Washington’s original recipe, and reflects his admiration of Philadelphia-style porters, especially those brewed by Robert Hare, whose original brewery stood just blocks from where ours is now.
