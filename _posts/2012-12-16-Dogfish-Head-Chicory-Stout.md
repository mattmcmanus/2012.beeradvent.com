### The Brewery

Dogfish Head Brewery is a brewing company based in Milton, Delaware founded by Sam Calagione. It opened in 1995 and produces 75,000 barrels of beer annually. Dogfish Head has been a rapidly growing brewery - it grew nearly 400% in between 2003 and 2006. The brewery was featured prominently in the documentary Beer Wars, and is the subject of the Discovery Channel series Brew Masters, which premiered Sunday, November 21, 2010. The brewery takes its name from Dogfish Head, Maine where founder Sam Calagione spent summers as a child. [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfish_Head_Brewery)

### The Beer

Chicory was one of the first beers we started brewing at our pub back when it opened in 1995. It's a dark beer made with a bunch of roasted chicory, organic Mexican coffee, St. John's Wort and licorice root. We use whole-leaf Cascade and Fuggle hops, as well as pale, roasted and oatmeal grains.

Back in 1995, we had a teeny, tiny brewing system and had to brew all day, every day to keep the bar stocked. Brewing with the same four ingredients got really boring really quickly. That's when Sam's ADD kicked in and he started adding some nontraditional ingredeints. [(Source)](http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/seasonal-brews/chicory-stout.htm)
