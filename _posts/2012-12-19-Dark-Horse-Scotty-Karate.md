### The Brewery

The Dark Horse Brewery is a microbrewery and tap room in Marshall, Michigan. The Dark Horse brews a variety of beers and beer styles, including the Crooked Tree India Pale Ale, Amber Ale, Raspberry Ale, Sapient Trip Ale, Boffo Brown Beer, and Black Bier. Several seasonal and experimental brews are also produced. They also offer a wide variety of food, with the cuisine centered around items which can be produced in their pizza ovens.
