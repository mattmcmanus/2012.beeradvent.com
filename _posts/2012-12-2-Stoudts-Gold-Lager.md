### The Brewery ###

Stoudt's Brewery is one of Pennsylvania's first micro breweries, located in the Lancaster County borough of Adamstown. Stoudt's Brewery was started in 1987 by Ed and Carol Stoudt, both of whom desired to own a restaurant, bakery, antique shop, and a brewery together. This was realized with the creation of Stoudt's as it includes a restaurant, a bakery, one of the East Coast' largest antique shops, as well as the brewery itself.

### The Beer

Gold has been recognized as one of the finest German-style beers brewed in America. The golden colored, smooth bodied Munich-style Helles is brewed with a 2 row base malt and 3 types or aromatic specialty malts, then finished with a kiss of noble hops. A quaffable beer, with subtle balance between sweet malt and clean crisp hops. [(Source)](http://www.stoudtsbeer.com/brewery_styles-flag-ship.html)
