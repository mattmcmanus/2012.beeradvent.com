### The Brewery

Avery Brewing Company is the culmination of several years of homebrewing experimentation by Adam Avery, President & /Brewmaster, to perfect the recipes for Redpoint Amber Ale, Ellieâ€™s Brown Ale, and Out of Bounds Stout. Production and sale of these three flagship beers began utilizing a 7 barrel brewhouse and 7 barrel Gundy tanks as fermenters and bright tanks. Out of Bounds Stout won a gold medal in 1994 in the category of dry stouts at the largest beer tasting event in North America, the Great American Beer Festival, held annually in Denver.

### The Beer

Our winter strong ale has a gorgeous mahogany hue, a hint of hazelnuts, and a finish reminiscent of mocha and toffee. No spices, just a perfect blend of five specialty malts. [(Source)](http://averybrewing.com/our-ales/old-jubilation-ale/)
