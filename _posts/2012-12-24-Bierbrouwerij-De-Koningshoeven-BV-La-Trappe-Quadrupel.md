### The Brewery ###

Worldwide, only seven Trappist beers remain. Six of these come from Belgium, one comes from The Netherlands, and that is La Trappe. The beer can only be called a ‘Trappist beer’ if it is brewed at a Trappist monastery under the supervision and responsibility of the monks

The sheep cage was renovated into a preliminary monastery, and on 5 March 1881, there was the first religious service at ‘Koningshoeven’. In order to sustain their lives, the monks in Koningshoeven started cultivating the arid heather soil, but it soon proved to take lots of effort for little reward. A solution had to be found, even more so because increasingly more candidates turned up and because the refuge turned into a lasting institution. When the farming business could no longer provide the basic support, the leading abbot, Nivardus Schweykart, decided to start a small brewery in 1884. Beer was the preferred drink of the people, so there were plenty of breweries. Nivardus Schweykart, himself the son of a brewer, sent monk Isidorus Laaber to Munich to learn the brewing process.

### The Beer ###

A unique Trappist beer that is even put to rest sorted by year in the cellars of the abbey for further fermentation. The strongest beer of La Trappe with a beautiful amber colour. The warm taste is full and well-balanced. A little bit sweet and pleasantly bitter. La Trappe Quadruple is also fermented in oak barrels.

Since 2008, we also age La Trappe Quadrupel in oak barrels. This gives the oak-aged Trappist beer an even fuller taste with a special wooded scent, which is comparable to wood-aged red wine. Starting June 2010 La Trappe Oak Aged is available in bottles of 37,5cl and exclusively for sale at the store at the brewery. [(Source)](http://www.latrappe.nl/content.asp?m=M7&s=P19&l=EN)
