### The Brewery ###

Tröegs is an American brewery originating in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. John and Chris Trogner founded the company in 1996. The name Tröegs is a combination of a nickname derived from the surname Trogner and the Dutch word kroeg ("pub"). Tröegs is a craft-brewery, or microbrewery focusing their production on specialty and seasonal beers. Tröegs also is a limited distribution brewery, only distributing beer to states within proximity to maintain beer freshness. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%B6egs_Brewing_Company)

### The Beer ### ###

Troegenator Double Bock is a dark, strong lager.  It pours into a glass with a bronze to brown color, fluffy white head and bready malt aroma. The Troegenator leaves a rich, warming feeling and subtle spicy flavors. The style, Double Bock, dates back a century or so ago. During periods of fasting without solid foods, the Monastic brewers relied on the Double Bock; a stronger, richer beer to fulfill their basic nutritional needs. Known to them as "liquid bread," a Double Bock has a strong malt aroma and rich chewy body. In the spirited tradition of naming a Double Bock using the suffix "-ator," we give you Troegenator to provide warmth and nourishment all throughout the year.
