### The Brewery ###

Goose Island Brewery is a brewery located in Chicago, Illinois, that began as a single brewpub known as Clybourn, which was opened in May 1988 by John Hall in Lincoln Park, Chicago, Illinois. Goose Island produces several year-round and seasonal styles of craft beer, the best-known of which are 312 Urban Wheat Ale and Honker's Ale. Goose Island also offers Root Beer and various sodas including Orange Cream and Grape soda. The beers are distributed across the United States and the United Kingdom, after a large stake of the company was sold to Widmer Brothers Brewery in 2006, and the brewery was able to expand into different markets. The brewer began distributing Matilda west of the Rockies in March 2010. Goose Island outsources the production of some of its beers. Honker's Ale and IPA sold on the east coast is now brewed under contract in New Hampshire. [(Source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_Island_Brewery)

### The Beer ###

Inspired by visits to English country pubs, Honker’s Ale combines a fruity hop aroma with a rich malt middle to create a perfectly balanced beer. Immensely drinkable, Honker’s Ale is not only the beer you can trust but one you’ll look forward to time and again. [(Source)](http://www.gooseisland.com/pages/honker_s_ale/17.php)
