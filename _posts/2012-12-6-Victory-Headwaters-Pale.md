### The Brewery

Victory Brewing Company opened its doors to the public on Feb. 15, 1996. What was once a Pepperidge Farm factory became home to a 144-seat restaurant, 70-foot-long bar and a full-scale brewery. In its first year, Victory Brewing Company brewed 1,725 barrels of beer.

Since then, Victory has increased the size of the restaurant to 300 seats. The brewery has also expanded, producing 82,000 barrels of beer in 2011. As loyal craft beer drinkers continue to show their dedication to flavorful, quality beer, Victory plans to continue its own growth. Onward to Victory!

### The Beer

This firmly crisp and aromatically arousing pale ale integrates a softly supportive malt base with underlies streams of herbal hop complexity. [(Source)](http://victorybeer.com/beers/headwaters-pale-ale/)
