### The Brewery

Firestone Walker Brewing Company brewed its first beer in 1996  in a small  facility rented from the Firestone Vineyard estate in Santa Barbara County.  In 2001 owners Adam Firestone and David Walker purchased the SLO Brewing Company located in Paso Robles, CA.

Firestone Walkerâ€™s ales are selectively fermented in the Firestone Union oak barrel brewing system. The Firestone Union incorporates 65-gallon, medium and heavy toast American oak barrels. [(Source)](http://www.firestonebeer.com/brewery/index.php)

### The Beer

Union Jack abounds with hop aroma and character. In fact this well balanced, west coast IPA is double dry hopped, giving it more and more of the grapefruit, citrus hop aroma and flavor it is known for. Overall it utilizes over four pounds of pacific-northwest hops per barrel. [(Source)](http://www.firestonebeer.com/beers/products/union-jack)
