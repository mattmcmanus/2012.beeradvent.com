## How does one participate in Beer Advent? ##

There are a couple things that make Beer Advent a lot more enjoyable than simply drinking a beer a day.

### Keep an open mind ###

You may be coming into the even thinking that you only like a certain beer style. I ask you to approach each beer as one you *may* love! Every one of the beers in here is made by craftsmen at the top of their trade. Take you time and let the beer settle. Try to pin point various flavors and compare them to earlier beers. I promise you that you will learn something that you can appreciate. 

### Take your time ###

There may be some times when you pour a beer from right out of the fridge and absolutley *hate* it. Don't stop there! A beer is best when it's had a little bit of time to warm up and settle down. I would recommend taking at least 45 minutes to finish a beer (if you have time, of course).

### Talk about the beers (on this site!) ###

One of the best ways to learn about all the various complexities in a beer to learn how to describe them. Sometimes attaching a flavor to a word is the hardest part. Once you know what to call it, it's easier pick it out. Take the time to write about the beers on the website! The more we share, hopefully the more we learn. 

### Throw a Beer Advent party ###

Enjoy the beers with people you love. Have a couple people over and share that evening's beer with some food and relax. It's the perfect excuse to get together without an adgenda.
